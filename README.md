# Create a console app that interacts with an API.
- This code asks the user to pick three Pokemon that have different types.
- The API will identify if the Pokemon exists and get its types.
- This API is called 'Pokéapi' pokeapi.co/.
- It gives access to data about Pokémon.
- This API is free and does not require any authentication.
- The code then checks that the Pokemon type has not been duplicated.
- The chosen Pokemon, if the the type is not duplicated, will be added to the deck, which is the file.
- Before running the code, create a file called Pokemon_deck.txt
- This is the file that the data from the API will be stored in.
